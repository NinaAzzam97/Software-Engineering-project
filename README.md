Software Engineering project in java language 


The High School Test System (HSTS) is a sophisticated computerized information system designed to streamline and centralize exam management in high schools, aiming to boost efficiency and reliability. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience in developing tailored information systems for educational contexts, delving into database management, user interface design, and educational technology intricacies.

In addition, collaborating with a diverse team underscored the importance of effective communication, task coordination, and leveraging individual strengths. The experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided insights into project management and teamwork dynamics in the realm of software development.
